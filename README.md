# HA-Audio-Analyzer-Add-on
Add-on to analyze sound using Behringer ECM-8000 and U-Phoria UMC202HD

INTRO
This audio analyzer was originally supposed to identify disturbing noise generated by a heat pump. This is why default settings are tailored for that heat pump noise problem.

SETUP
The setup contains an analogue Behringer microphone ECM-8000 with a good response for low frequency (compared to the standard MEMS microphones which normally don´t work well below 100hz). The microphone is connected to the digital analogue converter Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD using XLR cable. The converter is then connected with the Raspberry via USB.

FUNCTIONALITY
The analysis covers the following three main use features:
1. Ordinary frequency spectrum analyzer with selectable octaves on demand (not permanent to avoid data spam)
2. Event driven recording of frequency spectrum and original sound file based on defined trigger frequencies and amplitudes to save memmory and identify critical events
3. Listing of events containing heat pump states to generated correlations 
This is all managed using a dedicated html site which can be incorporated into Home Assistant menu (left menu area).

INSTALLATION
Use Home Assistant´s default installation of Add-ons and search for "HA-Audio-Analyzer-Add-on" and define according settings.
